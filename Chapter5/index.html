<!-- HEADER
We are adding two different sub headings (h6) to this page. 
One heading will be for the "Smartphone Edition" of the page 
and the second will be for the "Tablet Edition"
of the page. Both pages are the same but depending on
the screen size the pages CSS will tell the browser which
subheading to display.

SECTION: FEATURED ARTICLES
The featured article would be the main article on the page that will be featured. Think of it in this sense as the front page story on a newspaper - which makes sense since this demo's completed code would be a mock vintage newspaper layout.
The article contains several sections. You have the header section which contains the title of the article as well as
a "figure" or image that would be displayed with the article and any caption text that would go along with it.

SECTION: REGULAR ARTICLES
The regular articles on this page will be housed in this section of the document. The markup of this section is exactly the same as the featured articles section. The only difference will come down to how they are displayed based off their assigned styles.
